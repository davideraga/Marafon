Rules of Maraffone Beccacino

At the start of an hand a player chooses the briscola suit and plays first,
this player is decided at random first, and in the next hand is the player at the left of the player who started the last hand.
In each hand there are 10 rounds, in each round each player plays a card, in anti clockwise order, players must answer with a card of the same suit if they have any, if not they can play any card.
The player who played the highest card of the same suit of the first card, or the one who played the highest briscola wins the round, the player who has won the last round goes first in the next.
Who wins the round takes the value of the cards played, there is a one point bonus for the last round.
The first player of round can make one of tree signs or say the respective word word: "busso" knock, "volo",
"striscio". No other form of communication is allowed between the players.
Card rankings : 3 2 1 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 from highest rank to lower
Each card >= 8 ( in the previus ranking) is worth 1 "figure", the ace 1 is worth one point,  3 figures make a point

Details and implementation choices:
-Sometimes the first player in a game is determined by who has the 4 of denara, I have not implemented this because it breaks the simmetry between suits and the one between episodes
-Wins the game who scores >= 41 and more than the opponent at the end of the hand, not who scores 41 first
-The Maraffa is revealed automatically, as soon as the bricola is chosen.
-The right sign is chosen automatically, it's not possible to "stricio" if "busso" is possible
